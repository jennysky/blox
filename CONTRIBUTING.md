⚠️ Make sure to use node 18.

```
npm i
npm start
```
This will run the `docs` app similar to what you get when running `npm start` from an app that was created by `create-blox-app`, but with everything running locally and not installed from npm registry. 

Basically it means that `@blox-ui/core` and `@blox-ui/scripts` are running locally.
### Now you can create you awesome pr 🎉
