# Welcome to Blox

This is obviously a `demo` blox app, but it can be a good starting point for you to build your component library.

## **Blox** is fully customizable - Take control over your component lib app

Blox let you edit markdown files and integrate pieces of realtime sandboxes into it.

Use the menu to go through the components pages and see it in action.
